# Directive — view-consumer-gaps

**Authority:** APPROVED
**Drafted by:** @claude · **Approved by:** @teo (Owner)
**Effective:** 2026-09-08 · **Adoption decision:** LEDGER L-001
**Revision:** 2

## Owner Directive
Fix the consumer-measured view-layer gaps T-3, T-1 and T-4 now, and record T-2/T-5 as design
decisions only — per the recommendation adopted in chat 2026-09-08 ("start the fixes per your
recommendation").

## Outcome Criteria
- OC-01: With `fsTomSelectRemote` in place of `tomSelectRemote`, a `refreshState()` call while a
  load for the same value is already in flight fires no additional RPC and adds no duplicate
  options; a failed load clears the guard so a later call can retry — verifiable: jsTest pinning
  the guard state machine; end-to-end target (1 options RPC per selector on form open, measured
  via `performance.getEntriesByType('resource')`) attested by a consumer (mppArel).
- OC-02: The unsaved-changes cancel dialog resolves caption, text, Yes and No through KVision
  i18n (immediate `gettext`) with English source keys, so a consumer catalog translates all four
  — verifiable: jsTest over the extracted text provider; no raw dialog literal outside i18n
  resolution.
- OC-03: The help offcanvas caption, manual modal caption, and detached-window title are computed
  from the view label at open/click time (a label change after FAB construction is reflected —
  including fsLib's own `View.startDisplayPage` caller, wired to a live provider), and every
  user-facing string in `helpButtons.kt` routes through KVision i18n — `I18n.tr` lazy markers
  where a component's whole text is the key; immediate `gettext` for every interpolated string
  (a mid-string marker mistranslates or leaks) — verifiable: jsTest over the caption provider;
  grep (literals AND `.label` interpolations) shows no raw user-facing string in the file.
- OC-04: T-2 and T-5 each carry a LEDGER design entry (options, recommendation, falsification
  condition) and no implementation item exists for them in PLAN — verifiable: LEDGER L-006/L-007
  present; PLAN carries them only as deferred rows.

## Non-Goals
- Full jsMain string sweep; `:core` enum label changes; upstream patch submission; T-2/T-5 build.

## Governing Constraints
- Additive public API only — no removal or signature change of existing symbols (SemVer minor).
- `FsTomSelectRemote*` is a workaround and carries an explicit retirement condition — binding: L-003.
- New i18n keys use English sources; existing Spanish enum labels wrap at point of use — binding: L-005.

## Amendment Rule
Only an explicit Owner decision may change this file. Each amendment increments
Revision and records provenance in LEDGER (`DIRECTIVE R<N>:` rows).
